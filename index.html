                <h2>Introduction to the game</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>I do not remember exactly how old I was when I first began playing golf, but it was somewhere between 8 and 10 years old.
                    My brother and I would get the chance to play with my dad. My dad had just begun playing so we all sort of started learning
                    together. My brother and I were terrible and my dad was slightly less terrible. We played at some courses in St. Peters and 
                    some at the Lake of the Ozarks. The course I remember at the lake was Bay View Golf Course.

                    <h2>The High School Years</h2>
                    <section>
                    <p>When I got old enough to work, I began working at a local golf course. I was able to play golf
                        for free so I was able to increase my skills. I played as often as possible, especially during the summers.
                        The golf course I worked at was called "Emerald Greens Golf Course" and recently was closed because the property was bought by the St. Louis Zoo.

                    <h2>The College Years</h2>
                    <p>During college I continued to work at Emerald Greens while I was off on summer breaks. I would often work a morning and then play golf
                    in the afternoon. Some friends of mine who also worked there would also play with me and we would often play 2 vs 2. I got some new clubs
                    in the summer of 2009 and I still have them.

                    <h2>The Recent Years</h2>
                    <p>I have been able to play much less golf in the last few years but still get the chance to in the summer. I got a chance to 
                        play at a course in Pebble Beach, California in June of 2018. Pebble Beach is a famous golf community with extremely expensive courses
                        but I was able to play for free because a friend was working at the course at the time. The course is called Poppy Hills. It is pictured below.

                    <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
                    <p>I worked at Bellerive Country Club in the summer of 2018 and the PGA Championship was played there. It was a really neat experience and I got to be up 
                        close to a lot of the pros. Another interesting fact is that I have a goal of playing golf in all 50 states. I am very excited to do this but the list of 
                        states I have played in is still pretty small. They are listed below.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Missouri</li>
                        <li>Illinois</li>
                        <li>California</li>
